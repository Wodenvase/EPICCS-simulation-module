# EPICCS-simulation-module

Description

This project is an interactive simulation and game featuring an Arduino-powered autonomous car designed to disperse Pusa Bio Decomposer efficiently across a field for post-harvest stubble treatment. The simulation utilizes Q-learning (for small fields) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) (for larger fields) to optimize coverage. The website provides a real-time simulation and manual control mode, allowing users to experiment with navigation strategies.

Features

3D Interactive Simulation using Gazebo/PyBullet

Autonomous Navigation with ML algorithms (Q-learning & DQN)

Manual Control Mode (keyboard/touchscreen inputs)

Reward-Based Learning (+ve for new coverage, -ve for overlap/obstacles)

Real-time Statistics Dashboard (coverage %, overlap, time, AI progress)

User-Friendly Interface built with React.js & Three.js

Backend Integration with Flask/Node.js for ML model handling.
